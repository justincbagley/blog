<p>An up-to-date R install is a key component of any biologist&rsquo;s bioinformatics toolkit. In this post, I will walk through some code that I used to solve the problem of installing the latest version of R, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">R v3.4.4</a> (the &ldquo;2018-03-15, Someone to Lean On&rdquo; release), at the user level on a Linux supercomputing cluster running <a href="https://www.centos.org">CentOS 5/6/7</a>. First, I&rsquo;ll give some background information that will be useful for following along. Then, I&rsquo;ll go into the basics of conducting a Linux R install when you do not have admin privileges. Thirdly, I&rsquo;ll point out a library/environment problem that I ran into with this method, and I&rsquo;ll show a low-stress solution for solving that problem. And, finally, I&rsquo;ll close with the successful install setup steps and illustrate that the newly installed version of R v3.4.4 worked and was available from my command line.</p>

<h5 id="1-background-pre-install-environment">1. Background: pre-install environment</h5>

<p>On our cluster, I first used <a href="http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/howto/basic_usage.html"><code>qrsh</code></a> to log into a node and run or check the available R install, which gave me the following information:</p>

<pre><code>$ which R
/usr/global/R-3.3.2/bin/R
$
$ R

<p>This told me that the system administrator currently had R v3.3.2 installed, and that it was made available to all users at /usr/global/R-3.3.2/bin/R. This version is from one or two years back, so I wanted to install my own updated version of R in my <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html">home directory</a> (you can get the path to your home dir by doing <code>echo $HOME</code>).</p>

<h5 id="2-first-steps-local-r-install-within-my-user-home">2. First steps: local R install within my user &ldquo;$HOME&rdquo;</h5>

<p>To install R within my home directory, I started by following the standard install procedure for Linux, which involves downloading the source code as a tarball, unzipping that tarball, configuring the install, and performing the install. Note that you may see other biologists/scientists discussing tools such as <code>sudo</code>, <code>yum</code>, and <code>apt-get</code> for installing software on Linux. <strong>It is important to <em>note</em> that <em>none of these apply to the current case</em></strong>. The &ldquo;super user do&rdquo; command <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/blog/linux/linux-commands-for-beginners-sudo/"><code>sudo</code></a> is only used when you have admin privileges, and I am working as a user on an HPC cluster <em>without</em> such privileges (not in sudoers list). Therefore, and in addition, since <code>yum</code> often requires <code>sudo</code>, it is also off limits. Want to use <code>apt-get</code>? Nope. Think again. The <code>apt-get</code> command calls <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Apt">APT (Advanced Package Tool)</a>, which is a package tool manager that is only available on <a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian Linux</a>, and I am working on a cluster that runs CentOS. <strong>So, the appropriate CentOS approach, without admin privileges, is to use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"><code>wget</code></a> as follows:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ cd $HOME
$ wget http://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.4.tar.gz
$ tar xvf R-3.4.4.tar.gz
$ cd R-3.4.4
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/R
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
</code></pre>

<h5 id="3-the-problem-libiconv-configure-error">3. The problem: libiconv configure error</h5>

<p>Unfortunately, while running the standard install procedure above, I hit a snag in the form of the following configure error:</p>

<pre><code>checking whether iconv accepts &quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;latin1&quot;, &quot;ASCII&quot; and &quot;UCS-*&quot;... no
     configure: error: a suitable iconv is essential
</code></pre>

<h5 id="4-the-solution-point-to-lib-directory-with-libiconv-library-module-files">4. The solution: point to lib directory with libiconv library/module files</h5>

<p>I reasoned that the underlying issue causing this problem was that the libiconv library/module files were simply not being found. I suspected this library was installed within Miniconda, but was not sure, so I first checked for its presence and location. It&rsquo;s always safe and pretty fast to do this using Bioconda <a href="https://bioconda.github.io"><code>install</code></a>, which told me that libiconv was indeed already <em>installed</em>, and where it was located. So, I next looked to make sure libiconv files were in the Miniconda lib dir, and they were:</p>

<pre><code>$ ## Check/update libiconv:
$ conda install libiconv
Fetching package metadata .................
Solving package specifications: .

# All requested packages already installed.
# packages in environment at /gpfs_fs/home/jcbagley/miniconda2:
#
libiconv                  1.15                          0    conda-forge

$
$ which libiconv
$ cd ~/miniconda2/lib
$ ls ./libiconv*
./libiconv.a  ./libiconv.la  ./libiconv.so  ./libiconv.so.2  ./libiconv.so.2.6.0

</code></pre>

<p>The above listed the corresponding/correct lib files, so&hellip; I decided that the best solution at this point would be to add the Miniconda lib directory (folder) to my &ldquo;$LD_LIBRARY_PATH&rdquo; environmental variable. I did this using standard practices, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/gpfs_fs/home/jcbagley/miniconda2/lib
</code></pre>

<p><strong>I then went back and started a fresh R install, and configure as well as make and install worked!!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Still, a successful install is not a suitable stopping point in bioinformatics. The same applies to every R install.</strong></p>

<p>You must always make sure that the version of the software that you have installed is actually available from the command line, and not superseded by a previous install; and we want the appropriate R version to have priority. In my case, even after installing R v3.4.4 locally, I found that a call to R would open the system version, v3.3.2, which of course was suboptimal. One easy fix for this is to alias &ldquo;R&rdquo; to the newly installed version. Specifically, you could add the following line to your &ldquo;~/.bashrc&rdquo; file and then source it:</p>

<pre><code>alias R=&quot;$HOME/R/bin/R&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards, a call to R would always direct to the correct version corresponding to your user R install.</p>

<p>However, I realized that <strong>a better solution</strong> would be to move the &ldquo;R&rdquo; script generated during the R install (which is actually a shell script) into the main binary folder located within my &ldquo;$PATH&rdquo;, which for me is <code>~/local/bin</code>, and that&rsquo;s what I did:</p>

<pre><code>$ cp R Rscript ~/local/bin
$ cd ~
$ R

<p><strong><em>Problem solved!!</em> I hope this helps someone else overcome the libiconv configure error that I encountered and successfully add an updated R install to their Linux account. Let me know in the comments section below!</strong></p>
