    <div class="article-content">
      <p>There are few things that are more useful or necessary in evolutionary biology these days than learning new computational skills, including how to run software programs.  For this, there are a variety of sources of information: journal articles (methods papers/sections), library books, online books (e-Books), workshops, online tutorials, and internet blogs like this one.  Tutorials are among the best of these options given their practical focus, and because they often include step-by-step instructions with screenshots showing how to interact with GUIs, etc.  However, not all tutorials are created equal, and many leave something to be desired. </p>

<p>I think that elsewhere on this site I&rsquo;ve penned some pretty helpful posts on how to use BEAST software and related utilities.  But when you see a really great tutorial, it makes you say, &ldquo;Wow, this is really good, I wish I had written this.&rdquo;  That was my reaction when I recently saw a new (at least, new to me) BEAST2 tutorial written by the great Tracy Heath for the Bodega Bay Workshop in Applied Phylogenetics.  </p>

<p><strong>Here a link to Tracy&rsquo;s tutorial:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://treethinkers.org/divergence-time-estimation-using-beast/">Divergence Time Estimation using BEAST</a>, by Tracy Heath</p>

<p>Bodega Bay workshop leaders have long posted their tutorials online, and theirs have also long been some of the best analysis tutorials available in our field; but this one may be the best Bodega tutorial that I&rsquo;ve ever seen (there look to be some other new ones up from Bodega Bay though, so I&rsquo;ll have to look at those before making a final call on that!).  Why?  Because it really seems that everything is accounted for.  A PDF of detailed instructions with screenshots is given along with example input and output data plus a slideshow of the slides that Tracy actually uses to teach BEAST and guide users through its many possible options.</p>

<p>I think that everyone should go through this tutorial, regardless of how much experience you&rsquo;ve had using BEAST.  You might learn something you didn&rsquo;t already know.  This tutorial will also be a nice resource for those interested in writing labs for phylogenetics or molecular evolutionary analysis courses.</p>

<p>PS As the linked site and tutorial instructions emphasize, this tutorial is meant to be used with BEAST v2.1.3 or newer&ndash;if you disregard this point, all options in the tutorial may not be available to you.</p>
