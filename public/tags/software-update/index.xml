      <description>Hi BEAST users subscribed to justinbagley.org.Â As what is for many of you an academic summer starts winding down its backslope, this is a little reminder that you should try and finish all the BEAST analyses you&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off, and in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so already you should consider updating to the latest version of BEAST2, v2.3.0, which was released in June. Make sure you also update to the most up-to-date java version too; don&amp;rsquo;t worry, after the update BEAST v2.</description>

      <description>Hi BEAST users subscribed to justinbagley.org. Here&amp;rsquo;s a note to serve as a little reminder that, when you have a moment, you should update your BEAST2 software package to the latest version, v2.2.1, which was released last week.
As always, the new BEAST2 version works with the most up-to-date versions of java (e.g. version 8 update 31 from January, or version 8 update 40), which you no doubt have recently downloaded since they came out in the past three months.</description>
