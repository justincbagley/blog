      <title>Cochrane&#39;s Aphorism for Molecular Ecologists</title>

      <description>An apparently commonly cited axiom in evidence-based medical science and statistics is &amp;ldquo;Cochrane&amp;rsquo;s Aphorism&amp;rdquo;, named for Archie Cochrane.
Cochrane&amp;rsquo;s Aphorism states:
 &amp;ldquo;Before ordering a test, decide what you will do if it is (1) positive or (2) negative. If both answers are the same, don&amp;rsquo;t take the
test.&amp;rdquo;
–Archie Cochrane
 This quote is probably best known among doctors and nurses as an aid in making decisions about ordering laboratory tests for additional evidence, which published studies have shown is prone to overuse, redundancy, and sometimes also egregious errors.</description>

      <description>In 2012, the Evolution meetings were held in Ottawa, Canada as part of the 1st Joint Congress on Evolutionary Biology (combining meetings of the SSE, SSB, ASN, etc.). The meeting was excellent, and I remember I was present for the entire Molecular Ecology Symposium, which was moderated by Time Vines and Loren Riesberg, each of whom also gave talks, as I recall. From memory, the symposium was dominated by speakers interested in applying next-generation techniques to problems in population genetics, evolution, and adaptation, and there was also an excellent talk on long-term ecological research.</description>
