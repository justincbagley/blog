      <description>OK, I recently posted here about the new BEAST v1.8.3 release to let people know it was available (just echoing the announcement from Andrew Rambaut). Not sure about you, but when I get ahold of a new version of BEAST, I generally get it set up in my file system and try to run it. It&amp;rsquo;s good to go into this type of thing with a little dose of skepticism, as in my experience new versions of BEAST contain bug fixes but also seem to introduce new bugs or problems that you can run into.</description>

The new version supports several new features, and here is a list of the new stuff they&amp;rsquo;ve added to the program, taken from the website:</description>
