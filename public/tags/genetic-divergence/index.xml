      <description>I just wanted to jot down something simple that I just realized for the first time&amp;hellip; which is that DNA polymorphism indices usually reported in phylogeography and population genetics studies of fishes and other organisms vary in their degree of sensitivity to sampling (i.e. sample size).Â A number of these indices exist and are commonly&amp;ndash;actually increasingly&amp;ndash;reported, particularly since programs such as Arlequin and DnaSP provide excellent software resources for manipulating and analyzing data along these lines.</description>
