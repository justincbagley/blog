      <title>Getting BEAST v1.8.3 running! Beagle, CUDA, Java, and LINUX</title>

      <description>OK, I recently posted here about the new BEAST v1.8.3 release to let people know it was available (just echoing the announcement from Andrew Rambaut). Not sure about you, but when I get ahold of a new version of BEAST, I generally get it set up in my file system and try to run it. It&amp;rsquo;s good to go into this type of thing with a little dose of skepticism, as in my experience new versions of BEAST contain bug fixes but also seem to introduce new bugs or problems that you can run into.</description>

Hi guys, OK, in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, there is a new version of BEAST2, so make sure that you go get that update on GitHub. According to Remco Bouckaert, the new version, v2.3.2, improves the ability of the user to interact with data in BEAUti, and it also improves the efficiency of some BEAST functions, particularly the MRCAPrior. Moreover, LogCombiner has been fixed to ensure logcombiner burn in editing finished properly, and LogAnalyser now has one line per file mode.</description>

      <description>Yet again, a new version of an important piece of software for molecular ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and biogeographers has just become available. Mary Kuhner and colleagues have just released a new version of the software program Lamarc, a program that originally only implemented likelihood analysis but now implements ML and Bayesian algorithms for estimating population migration rates (gene flow), population sizes, exponential growth rates and recombination rates. You can download the most up-to-date version of Lamarc, Lamarc v2.</description>
