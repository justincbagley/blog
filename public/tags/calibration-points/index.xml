      <description>Background
In a previous blog post, which has received quite a bit of attention, I detailed how to get &amp;ldquo;off to a good start&amp;rdquo; by generating a starting tree for your BEAST analyses. The goal was to work from a tree with branch lengths in units of substitutions per site and to finish with an ultrametric, time-calibrated tree topology with node ages matching calibration points (e.g. fossil ages) you intended to use in BEAST.</description>
