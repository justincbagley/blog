      <description>An up-to-date R install is a key component of any biologist&amp;rsquo;s bioinformatics toolkit. In this post, I will walk through some code that I used to solve the problem of installing the latest version of R, R v3.4.4 (the &amp;ldquo;2018-03-15, Someone to Lean On&amp;rdquo; release), at the user level on a Linux supercomputing cluster running CentOS 5/6/7. First, I&amp;rsquo;ll give some background information that will be useful for following along.</description>

Oh, SNAPP&amp;hellip;
Over the last year, as I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly comfortable with GitHub, I&amp;rsquo;ve naturally shifted all of my note writing to Markdown language. During the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve started frequently jotting down useful notes related to analysis, code, or scientific computing as &amp;ldquo;Gists&amp;rdquo; on GitHub. In contrast to most repositories, Gists are small snippets of code or notes and are posted at gist.github.com rather than github.com. To date, I have published 8 Gists on topics as broad as Pandoc, ∂a∂i, SNAPP, and Markdown.</description>

      <description>AMOVA in R Resources for conducting population genetic and phylogenetic analyses in the R computing environment are continually improving, and to date several packages have provided functions for estimating phi-statistics and hierarchical patterns of population variance partitioning using AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance; Quattro et al. 1992). The paper for the AMOVA method, penned by population geneticists Joe Quattro, Peter Smouse, and Laurent Excoffier, now has &amp;gt;12,000 citations, making it one of the most used and cited methods of all time in evolutionary genetic analysis; many people continue using this method, including me.</description>

      <description>Research projects in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology increasingly rely upon ecological modeling and GIS data and tools for manipulating and analyzing spatially linked data from across a variety of spatial scales. Of particular importance are species distribution modeling (SDM; also known as Ecological Niche Models, or ENMs, or Environmental Niche Models) and niche divergence tools, geospatial data layers representing Earth environments from a variety of perspectives and scales, and GIS and mapping software.</description>

      <title>Automatically install or update all phylogenetics packages in R</title>

      <description>In case you are unaware of this trick, it is possible to simultaneously install or update all of the phylogenetics packages available in R in one fail swoop.
A number of different CRAN Task Views have been created summarizing R packages and utilities for different fields of analysis or research. Luckily, there is not only a compilation of these located on the CRAN-R website here, but also Brian O&amp;rsquo;Meara (@omearabrian #omearabrian) has developed a nice CRAN Task View entitled &amp;ldquo;Phylogenetics, Especially Comparative Methods.</description>

      <description>From time to time, we make mistakes in programming or testing a new R script or function, only to find that R &amp;ldquo;freezes&amp;rdquo; and appears to be stuck, or working but giving the impression that it will take an eternity to complete the computation. What could be happening is that the process is based on an maximum-likelihood estimation of a parameter that requires convergence, you could have accidentally (e.g. by default) run a function that needs to visit the total number of models possible for your dataset or a certain amount of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Dealing with negative phylogenetic branch lengths in BEAST starting trees</title>
      <link>/2016/03/01/dealing-negative-phylogenetic-branch-lengths-beast-starting-trees/</link>

      <description>Negative branch lengths and the BEAST When conducting phylogenetic analyses, you will from time to time encounter negative branch lengths. Negative branch lengths are a nuisance because they can cause substantial visualization problems or keep analyses (e.g. downstream analyses in other programs) from running.
For example, it will be desirable in many cases to add a starting tree to input files for datasets with phylogeographical sampling (e.g. multiple individuals in a standard BEAST analysis, or a *BEAST species tree analysis with multiple individuals sampled per species/population modeled).</description>

      <description>Background
In a previous blog post, which has received quite a bit of attention, I detailed how to get &amp;ldquo;off to a good start&amp;rdquo; by generating a starting tree for your BEAST analyses. The goal was to work from a tree with branch lengths in units of substitutions per site and to finish with an ultrametric, time-calibrated tree topology with node ages matching calibration points (e.g. fossil ages) you intended to use in BEAST.</description>

      <title>New book on phylogenetic comparative analysis in R</title>

      <guid>/2014/04/30/new-book-phylogenetic-comparative-analysis-r/</guid>
      <description>I just found out about this and it is definitely going on my Want List. Springer has just this year published Nick Swenson&amp;rsquo;s new book entitled Functional and Phylogenetic Ecology in R. This book looks very useful for anyone interested in phylogenetic analysis of ecological adaptation or diversity using the R environment. Check it out and buy it direct from Spring here.
One cool thing about this book is that it provides examples on integrating R code with code/programs from Python and C.</description>

      <description>The packages
Here is my comprehensive list of phylogenetics packages for R, with links to their websites (for some, links to support pages or more detailed information are provided in subsequent sections). The requirement for inclusion in the list is at least one function related to manipulation or analysis of phylogenetic data. Please E-mail me if you know of another program to add, or if you are developing a new package for phylogenetics in R.</description>

      <description>BEAST and user trees
The program BEAST (e.g. latest release version v1.8.0; or v2.1.1; Drummond et al. 2012) is increasingly more and more popular and important in the fields of evolutionary biology and the biology of infectious diseases. When conducting MCMC simulations to simultaneously make phylogenetic inference and estimate divergence times, and/or coalescent model parameters (summary statistics) in BEAST, it is usually necessary, and desirable, to provide some form of calibrated tree priors.</description>

      <description>OK, in this post I will be reviewing some R functions for phylogenetics, walking you through some ways of working with phylogenies within the R environment. First, install R (http://cran.r-project.org/) on your computer. Also install the phylogenetics packages APE (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html), geiger (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geiger/index.html) and caper (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caper/index.html) on your machine using links at these URLs, or using the &amp;lsquo;Install packages&amp;rsquo; option within the &amp;lsquo;Packages&amp;rsquo; dropdown menu of the R gui), in the appropriate library folder (e.</description>
