      <description>An up-to-date R install is a key component of any biologist&amp;rsquo;s bioinformatics toolkit. In this post, I will walk through some code that I used to solve the problem of installing the latest version of R, R v3.4.4 (the &amp;ldquo;2018-03-15, Someone to Lean On&amp;rdquo; release), at the user level on a Linux supercomputing cluster running CentOS 5/6/7. First, I&amp;rsquo;ll give some background information that will be useful for following along.</description>

      <description>Recently, back in February of 2018, I updated Xcode and installed the macOS High Sierra Supplemental Update as well. I was quite unhappy to find out that, following these updates, compiling software written in C/C++ using gcc (which was up to date!) seemed to be failing with a &amp;ldquo;stdio.h&amp;rdquo; file not found error, as follows:
...fatal error: stdio.h: No such file or directory #import&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;; ^ 1 error generated. ...  The missing file was the same in multiple cases, for multiple software programs that I think included both the species tree inference software SVDquartets and the popgen/selection forward-time simulation program SFS_CODE.</description>
