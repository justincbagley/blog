Oh, SNAPP&amp;hellip;
Over the last year, as I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly comfortable with GitHub, I&amp;rsquo;ve naturally shifted all of my note writing to Markdown language. During the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve started frequently jotting down useful notes related to analysis, code, or scientific computing as &amp;ldquo;Gists&amp;rdquo; on GitHub. In contrast to most repositories, Gists are small snippets of code or notes and are posted at gist.github.com rather than github.com. To date, I have published 8 Gists on topics as broad as Pandoc, ∂a∂i, SNAPP, and Markdown.</description>
