      <description>First, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to and see this blog entry in its original context, then read my original stackoverflow answer here.
So, according to blogdown authors (Xie et al. 2018), it&amp;rsquo;s been said before that,
 &amp;ldquo;If you don’t have a website nowadays, you don’t exist&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Carlos Scheidegger.
 A quick search online returns blog posts and sites with several variations on this them (e.g. here and here) acknowledging the axiomatic importance of an online presence these days.</description>

      <description>Thanks to PeerJ Preprints I am very pleased to be able to report two pieces of positive news for today:
  **Our new preprint, which presents the results of a comparative phylogeography study, is now published online at PeerJ Preprints (as of yesterday) and ** I had a very positive experience submitting my preprint to this service.   
The Paper
One reason I&amp;rsquo;m excited about this new paper is that it addresses a highly relevant issue in evolutionary biology: inferring mechanisms underpinning biotic assembly and diversification in Neotropical species assemblages.</description>
