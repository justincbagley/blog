      <description>My new *BEAST (starbeast) species tree runs are converging wonderfully in BEAST v1.8.3, so I am off to a great start this morning. Here, I&amp;rsquo;m including a screenshot of the results of one of these runs, which I ran for 200 million generations using 3 normally distributed calibration points, as visualized in Tracer. Note the good posterior trace, very high ESS scores for all parameter estimates, and good use of burn-in (default 10% value works quite well in this case).</description>

      <description>OK, heads up everyone using BEAST, or interested in summarizing and analyzing the results of Bayesian analyses in other software programs! There is a new version of the program Tracer available at Andrew Rambaut&amp;rsquo;s website. You can obtain the new version of Tracer, Tracer v1.6 by downloading the appropriate version here. The new version supports several new features, and here is a list of the new stuff they&amp;rsquo;ve added to the program, taken from the website:</description>
