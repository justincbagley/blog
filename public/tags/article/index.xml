      <description>Thanks to PeerJ Preprints I am very pleased to be able to report two pieces of positive news for today:
  **Our new preprint, which presents the results of a comparative phylogeography study, is now published online at PeerJ Preprints (as of yesterday) and ** I had a very positive experience submitting my preprint to this service.   
The Paper
One reason I&amp;rsquo;m excited about this new paper is that it addresses a highly relevant issue in evolutionary biology: inferring mechanisms underpinning biotic assembly and diversification in Neotropical species assemblages.</description>

      <description>Find Open Access scholarly articles online for free
The topic is peer-reviewed scientific articles (primary or secondary literature). Also, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume that you&amp;rsquo;re not searching for a paper from an Open Access publisher. Let&amp;rsquo;s also assumeÂ that library holdings / subscriptions at your institution have gaps&amp;ndash;they do not cover every journal in your field over every possible time period.
Then, Bagley&amp;rsquo;s Law of Scientific Publication Access is:
 &amp;ldquo;When you need an article, you will not have free access to it, but you will have access to plenty of articles that you don&amp;rsquo;t want and you don&amp;rsquo;t need.</description>
