      <description>In case you are unaware of this trick, it is possible to simultaneously install or update all of the phylogenetics packages available in R in one fail swoop.
A number of different CRAN Task Views have been created summarizing R packages and utilities for different fields of analysis or research. Luckily, there is not only a compilation of these located on the CRAN-R website here, but also Brian O&amp;rsquo;Meara (@omearabrian #omearabrian) has developed a nice CRAN Task View entitled &amp;ldquo;Phylogenetics, Especially Comparative Methods.</description>

      <description>The packages
Here is my comprehensive list of phylogenetics packages for R, with links to their websites (for some, links to support pages or more detailed information are provided in subsequent sections). The requirement for inclusion in the list is at least one function related to manipulation or analysis of phylogenetic data. Please E-mail me if you know of another program to add, or if you are developing a new package for phylogenetics in R.</description>
