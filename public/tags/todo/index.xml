      <description>Thanks to PeerJ Preprints I am very pleased to be able to report two pieces of positive news for today:
  **Our new preprint, which presents the results of a comparative phylogeography study, is now published online at PeerJ Preprints (as of yesterday) and ** I had a very positive experience submitting my preprint to this service.   
The Paper
One reason I&amp;rsquo;m excited about this new paper is that it addresses a highly relevant issue in evolutionary biology: inferring mechanisms underpinning biotic assembly and diversification in Neotropical species assemblages.</description>
