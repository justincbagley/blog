      <description>I have now for several months been happily using BEAST2 instead of Beast 1.7.5 or 1.8.x&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m converted! Thus far, datasets have run surprisingly smoothly, but for some recent analyses I have tried to jump-start things and ensure proper likelihood values at the onset of runs by including a starting tree in my xml input file.
Previously, I blogged about just how you might create such a starting tree that fits one or multiple calibration points in a BEAST analysis, by using penalized likelihood analysis (r8s) in R.</description>

      <description>BEAST and user trees
The program BEAST (e.g. latest release version v1.8.0; or v2.1.1; Drummond et al. 2012) is increasingly more and more popular and important in the fields of evolutionary biology and the biology of infectious diseases. When conducting MCMC simulations to simultaneously make phylogenetic inference and estimate divergence times, and/or coalescent model parameters (summary statistics) in BEAST, it is usually necessary, and desirable, to provide some form of calibrated tree priors.</description>
