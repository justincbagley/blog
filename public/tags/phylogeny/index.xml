      <description>Negative branch lengths and the BEAST When conducting phylogenetic analyses, you will from time to time encounter negative branch lengths. Negative branch lengths are a nuisance because they can cause substantial visualization problems or keep analyses (e.g. downstream analyses in other programs) from running.
For example, it will be desirable in many cases to add a starting tree to input files for datasets with phylogeographical sampling (e.g. multiple individuals in a standard BEAST analysis, or a *BEAST species tree analysis with multiple individuals sampled per species/population modeled).</description>

      <description>Evolutionary biologists generally use nice java-written utility programs that come in the standard BEAST distribution to obtain post-burnin trees for summarizing the results of a converged BEAST run (or *BEAST run) that reached stationarity. Usually, only 5,000 to 20,000 trees are necessary for this, and these are typically obtained by cutting out &amp;lsquo;burnin&amp;rsquo; trees and then &amp;ldquo;thinning&amp;rdquo; trees from &amp;ldquo;.trees&amp;rdquo; output files using LogCombiner until the desired number of trees is reached.</description>

      <title>New web server update for Bayesian PTP species delimitation on single-locus gene trees - and more!</title>

      <description>Recently, biologists have been developing statistically more rigorous methods that &amp;lsquo;put the teeth into&amp;rsquo; species delimitation, including species discovery approaches, and provide what appears to be new steps towards more automated means of taking advantage of DNA sequence data for these purposes. This is critical given the current biodiversity crisis.
Among the new methods, two sets of methods take similar approaches to delimit species from one or multiple phylogenetic trees. These methods, the general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model and the Poisson tree process (PTP) model, were initially developed to use coalescent or non-coalescent statistical algorithms to delimit species on single-locus gene trees, e.</description>

      <description>BEAST and user trees
The program BEAST (e.g. latest release version v1.8.0; or v2.1.1; Drummond et al. 2012) is increasingly more and more popular and important in the fields of evolutionary biology and the biology of infectious diseases. When conducting MCMC simulations to simultaneously make phylogenetic inference and estimate divergence times, and/or coalescent model parameters (summary statistics) in BEAST, it is usually necessary, and desirable, to provide some form of calibrated tree priors.</description>

      <description>I love going online and finding new websites with useful information. Here are a few recent websites related to evolutionary analysis using phylogenetic systematics, and particularly related to phylogenetic hypothesis testing.
