      <description>Recently, I discovered something that I wrote about four years ago during the first part of my PhD, just 2 years or so after IMa2 had come out [around a year or so after Hey (2010)]. Back then, I was a little unhappy about the way parameters were coded, but now looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of funny, so I decided to post this as a blog entry. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;ve published with this method and have a much better understanding of it now.</description>

      <description>There are few things that are more useful or necessary in evolutionary biology these days than learning new computational skills, including how to run software programs. For this, there are a variety of sources of information: journal articles (methods papers/sections), library books, online books (e-Books), workshops, online tutorials, and internet blogs like this one. Tutorials are among the best of these options given their practical focus, and because they often include step-by-step instructions with screenshots showing how to interact with GUIs, etc.</description>
