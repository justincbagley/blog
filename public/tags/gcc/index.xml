      <description>Recently, back in February of 2018, I updated Xcode and installed the macOS High Sierra Supplemental Update as well. I was quite unhappy to find out that, following these updates, compiling software written in C/C++ using gcc (which was up to date!) seemed to be failing with a &amp;ldquo;stdio.h&amp;rdquo; file not found error, as follows:
...fatal error: stdio.h: No such file or directory #import&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;; ^ 1 error generated. ...  The missing file was the same in multiple cases, for multiple software programs that I think included both the species tree inference software SVDquartets and the popgen/selection forward-time simulation program SFS_CODE.</description>
