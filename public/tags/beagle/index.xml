      <description>BEAST2 PathSampler
I am a relatively big Mac (UNIX) and Linux fan, as many of you know. So, my standard approach to running BEAST or BEAST2 is to use my Mac for local setup and testing and then employ shell scripts (effective wrappers) that I&amp;rsquo;ve developed to automate final run setup and queuing on a Linux supercomputing cluster.
