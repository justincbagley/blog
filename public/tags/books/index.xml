      <description>I just found out about this and it is definitely going on my Want List. Springer has just this year published Nick Swenson&amp;rsquo;s new book entitled Functional and Phylogenetic Ecology in R. This book looks very useful for anyone interested in phylogenetic analysis of ecological adaptation or diversity using the R environment. Check it out and buy it direct from Spring here.
One cool thing about this book is that it provides examples on integrating R code with code/programs from Python and C.</description>
