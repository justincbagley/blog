      <description>I have now for several months been happily using BEAST2 instead of Beast 1.7.5 or 1.8.x&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m converted! Thus far, datasets have run surprisingly smoothly, but for some recent analyses I have tried to jump-start things and ensure proper likelihood values at the onset of runs by including a starting tree in my xml input file.
Previously, I blogged about just how you might create such a starting tree that fits one or multiple calibration points in a BEAST analysis, by using penalized likelihood analysis (r8s) in R.</description>
