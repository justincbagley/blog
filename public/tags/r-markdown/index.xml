      <description>Post This is my first blogdown post, written in Markdown from within the R console in RStudio Version 1.1.453 (released this year, available here). As I have no content prepared for this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll just throw in a couple of quotes from some of my favorite evolutionary biologists instead, as follows:
 â€œThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved.</description>
