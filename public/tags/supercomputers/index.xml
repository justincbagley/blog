      <description>Here, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a Gist that I recently wrote, and just updated today, about setting up an account on a Linux supercomputer for analyzing RAD-seq data (e.g. from ddRAD-seq, 2bRAD methods).
Here&amp;rsquo;s the Gist&amp;hellip;

      <description>At the time of this writing, I am fortunate to be doing my PhD at BYU, which is a great environment to work on biogeography, systematics and evolution mainly because of the great people with similar interests that seem to always be attracted to the place. However, I am also very fortunate that at my institution we have excellent infrastructure and internal resources for conducting the highest quality research in molecular evolution and ecology.</description>
