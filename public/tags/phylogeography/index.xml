      <title>Updated links to BEAST 1.7.5 phylogeography tutorials</title>

      <description>As you know, BEAST is being developed by two separate groups of biologists and computer scientists, those working on beast 1.7&amp;frasl;8 and those devleoping Beast2. BEAST is essentially the main evolutionary analysis program now for phylogenetics, historical biogeography, species delimitation, and different phylogeography approaches; so it matters when there is an update. This is just a quick post to highlight that changes to BEAST 1.7.5 phylogeography tutorials have been made, in case you didn&amp;rsquo;t get word of this through recent emails.</description>

      <title>Lower Central America phylogeography: review paper gets 100 views in 2 days on Academia.edu!</title>

      <description>Hopefully, it is a sign that your new paper is going to get cited when it starts getting attention immediately after it becomes available online. This appears to be happening with our new review of the phylogeographic literature from the lower Central American Neotropics, entitled &amp;ldquo;Phylogeography and biogeography of the lower Central American Neotropics: diversification between two continents and between two seas&amp;rdquo; (Bagley &amp;amp; Johnson 2014, Biological Reviews). I just put this paper up on Academia.</description>

      <description>In 2012, the Evolution meetings were held in Ottawa, Canada as part of the 1st Joint Congress on Evolutionary Biology (combining meetings of the SSE, SSB, ASN, etc.). The meeting was excellent, and I remember I was present for the entire Molecular Ecology Symposium, which was moderated by Time Vines and Loren Riesberg, each of whom also gave talks, as I recall. From memory, the symposium was dominated by speakers interested in applying next-generation techniques to problems in population genetics, evolution, and adaptation, and there was also an excellent talk on long-term ecological research.</description>

      <description>Part I. Draft 9/22/11
WARNING: The following is based on my current understanding and use of Mesquite to perform coalescent simulations for phylogeographical hypotheses testing and is correct to the best of my knowledge, but I do not guarantee its accuracy. Also, you may not perform these analyses in the exact way or order that I have performed them. The following is based on a number of previously-published studies (e.g. Knowles 2001; Knowles &amp;amp; Maddison 2002; Carstens et al.</description>

      <title>How to use MIGRATE-N for phylogeography</title>
      <link>/2010/09/04/how-to-use-migrate-n-for-phylogeography/</link>

      <description>Introduction to MIGRATE-N One thing that makes this a great time to be involved in phylogeography is the exploding amount of data and quantitative methods available to workers. An important advance in the past 10 years has been the introduction of likelihood- and Bayesian inference-based methods for modeling gene flow, and for comparing models of gene flow, in population genetics. In particular, model-based coalescent methods are highly attractive. A method (or class of methods) that stems from statistical population genetics and is useful in phylogeography involves using coalescent gene genealogy samplers to estimate parameters based on variation across a huge number of gene trees representing estimates of probable ancestral patterns.</description>
