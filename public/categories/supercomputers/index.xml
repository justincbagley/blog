      <description>An up-to-date R install is a key component of any biologist&amp;rsquo;s bioinformatics toolkit. In this post, I will walk through some code that I used to solve the problem of installing the latest version of R, R v3.4.4 (the &amp;ldquo;2018-03-15, Someone to Lean On&amp;rdquo; release), at the user level on a Linux supercomputing cluster running CentOS 5/6/7. First, I&amp;rsquo;ll give some background information that will be useful for following along.</description>

      <title>How To Setup A Linux Supercomputer for RAD-seq</title>

      <description>Here, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a Gist that I recently wrote, and just updated today, about setting up an account on a Linux supercomputer for analyzing RAD-seq data (e.g. from ddRAD-seq, 2bRAD methods).
Here&amp;rsquo;s the Gist&amp;hellip;

      <title>Getting BEAST v1.8.3 running! Beagle, CUDA, Java, and LINUX</title>

      <description>OK, I recently posted here about the new BEAST v1.8.3 release to let people know it was available (just echoing the announcement from Andrew Rambaut). Not sure about you, but when I get ahold of a new version of BEAST, I generally get it set up in my file system and try to run it. It&amp;rsquo;s good to go into this type of thing with a little dose of skepticism, as in my experience new versions of BEAST contain bug fixes but also seem to introduce new bugs or problems that you can run into.</description>

      <description>At the time of this writing, I am fortunate to be doing my PhD at BYU, which is a great environment to work on biogeography, systematics and evolution mainly because of the great people with similar interests that seem to always be attracted to the place. However, I am also very fortunate that at my institution we have excellent infrastructure and internal resources for conducting the highest quality research in molecular evolution and ecology.</description>
