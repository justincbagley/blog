      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little behind on my blogging (sorry!), but a few weeks ago, we had Dr. Luke Mahler here at BYU. Luke is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the UC Davis Center for Population Biology (CPB) and was selected by the graduate students for a visit here at the Department of Biology. He gave a great talk at our departmental seminar on his work on convergent evolution and the &amp;lsquo;macroevolutionary landscape&amp;rsquo; in Anolis lizards from the Greater Antilles and North American Gulf-Atlantic coast, which presents a new comparative method and was recently published in Science (check it out here).</description>
