      <description>Just FYI, there was yet another great phyloseminar, today, as part of a series of talks on using fossil data in phylogenetics (two weeks ago, Tracy Heath gave a talk on the Fossilized Birth-Death process model).
Today&amp;rsquo;s talk, which I missed but will watch later since these are always recorded, was given by Daniel Ksepka (NESCENT) and was entitled, &amp;ldquo;Including Fossil Taxa in Phylogenies: Advances and Issues&amp;rdquo;.
I suspect that a lot of people missed this talk but will want to see it!</description>
