      <description>Recently, I discovered something that I wrote about four years ago during the first part of my PhD, just 2 years or so after IMa2 had come out [around a year or so after Hey (2010)]. Back then, I was a little unhappy about the way parameters were coded, but now looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of funny, so I decided to post this as a blog entry. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;ve published with this method and have a much better understanding of it now.</description>
