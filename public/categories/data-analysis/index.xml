      <title>How to find common variants in multiple VCF files</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What are the SNPs or variants that are shared in common between two VCF files I created (e.g. from different SNP discovery pipelines, or two treatments of an experiment)?&amp;rdquo;, you might ask.
Below, I provide a post based on my recent answer to this ResearchGate question that provides some solutions for this problem.
First, the vcftools --diff &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt; --diff-site option would work for this specific case. This option for the --diff flag is listed in the documentation as having the following function:</description>

      <description>AMOVA in R Resources for conducting population genetic and phylogenetic analyses in the R computing environment are continually improving, and to date several packages have provided functions for estimating phi-statistics and hierarchical patterns of population variance partitioning using AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance; Quattro et al. 1992). The paper for the AMOVA method, penned by population geneticists Joe Quattro, Peter Smouse, and Laurent Excoffier, now has &amp;gt;12,000 citations, making it one of the most used and cited methods of all time in evolutionary genetic analysis; many people continue using this method, including me.</description>

      <description>JC model of sequence evolution from TreeThinkers.
BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) software provides a growing set of clear options for specifying evolutionary models of DNA substitution for alignments loaded into the program. However, the set of models that are readily available and &amp;ldquo;spelled out&amp;rdquo; in drop-down menus in the BEAUti (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility) GUI is much smaller compared to the standard set of 11 substitution schemes considered by other software programs for model selection (giving rise to a total of 88 models in jModelTest, or 56 models in PartitionFinder).</description>
