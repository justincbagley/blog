Oh, SNAPP&amp;hellip;
Over the last year, as I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly comfortable with GitHub, I&amp;rsquo;ve naturally shifted all of my note writing to Markdown language. During the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve started frequently jotting down useful notes related to analysis, code, or scientific computing as &amp;ldquo;Gists&amp;rdquo; on GitHub. In contrast to most repositories, Gists are small snippets of code or notes and are posted at gist.github.com rather than github.com. To date, I have published 8 Gists on topics as broad as Pandoc, ∂a∂i, SNAPP, and Markdown.</description>

      <title>Latest *BEAST trace: Most beautiful thing I&#39;ve seen today</title>

      <description>My new *BEAST (starbeast) species tree runs are converging wonderfully in BEAST v1.8.3, so I am off to a great start this morning. Here, I&amp;rsquo;m including a screenshot of the results of one of these runs, which I ran for 200 million generations using 3 normally distributed calibration points, as visualized in Tracer. Note the good posterior trace, very high ESS scores for all parameter estimates, and good use of burn-in (default 10% value works quite well in this case).</description>

      <description>BEAST and user trees
The program BEAST (e.g. latest release version v1.8.0; or v2.1.1; Drummond et al. 2012) is increasingly more and more popular and important in the fields of evolutionary biology and the biology of infectious diseases. When conducting MCMC simulations to simultaneously make phylogenetic inference and estimate divergence times, and/or coalescent model parameters (summary statistics) in BEAST, it is usually necessary, and desirable, to provide some form of calibrated tree priors.</description>

      <description>Part I. Draft 9/22/11
WARNING: The following is based on my current understanding and use of Mesquite to perform coalescent simulations for phylogeographical hypotheses testing and is correct to the best of my knowledge, but I do not guarantee its accuracy. Also, you may not perform these analyses in the exact way or order that I have performed them. The following is based on a number of previously-published studies (e.g. Knowles 2001; Knowles &amp;amp; Maddison 2002; Carstens et al.</description>
