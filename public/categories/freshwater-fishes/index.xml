Fans of North American freshwater fishes will be interested to know that there are several online resources for obtaining information about California&amp;rsquo;s native and introduced freshwater fish fauna.Â I recently discovered two of these resources, the Native Fish Species By Location - California Fish Site of the California Freshwater Fish Laboratory, led by Lisa Thompson, and the California fish distribution datasets from The Nature Conservancy&amp;rsquo;s (TNC) Hexagon Project (Data Basin Gallery), developed by Peter Moyle and Paul Randall at UC Davis.</description>
