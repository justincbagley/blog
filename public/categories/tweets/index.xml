      <description>I posted this little graphic earlier @justincbagley to support the exposition of stupid common names on Twitter today (hashtag #stupidcommonnames).
A guilty pleasure, but I had so much fun in the very short time I spent making it that I decided to also post it here. Go check the rest of the stupid common names other scientists have identified and have a good laugh. &amp;ldquo;Tigerfish&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Tiger Fish&amp;rdquo; is definitely a stupid name: these fish don&amp;rsquo;t look like tigers, aren&amp;rsquo;t codistributed with tigers, don&amp;rsquo;t interact with tigers, and generally aren&amp;rsquo;t really formally associated with tigers (or any other mammals, except human sport fishermen) in any way.</description>
