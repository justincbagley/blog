      <title>How To Setup A Linux Supercomputer for RAD-seq</title>

      <description>Here, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a Gist that I recently wrote, and just updated today, about setting up an account on a Linux supercomputer for analyzing RAD-seq data (e.g. from ddRAD-seq, 2bRAD methods).
Here&amp;rsquo;s the Gist&amp;hellip;

Oh, SNAPP&amp;hellip;
Over the last year, as I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly comfortable with GitHub, I&amp;rsquo;ve naturally shifted all of my note writing to Markdown language. During the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve started frequently jotting down useful notes related to analysis, code, or scientific computing as &amp;ldquo;Gists&amp;rdquo; on GitHub. In contrast to most repositories, Gists are small snippets of code or notes and are posted at gist.github.com rather than github.com. To date, I have published 8 Gists on topics as broad as Pandoc, ∂a∂i, SNAPP, and Markdown.</description>

      <title>Running AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance) on biallelic SNP data in R</title>

      <description>AMOVA in R Resources for conducting population genetic and phylogenetic analyses in the R computing environment are continually improving, and to date several packages have provided functions for estimating phi-statistics and hierarchical patterns of population variance partitioning using AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance; Quattro et al. 1992). The paper for the AMOVA method, penned by population geneticists Joe Quattro, Peter Smouse, and Laurent Excoffier, now has &amp;gt;12,000 citations, making it one of the most used and cited methods of all time in evolutionary genetic analysis; many people continue using this method, including me.</description>

      <description>Intro Given their high density throughout the genome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have become a popular marker for population genetics and phylogenetics analyses in evolutionary biology (in addition to applications in QTL mapping, association studies etc.). The rapid advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has created several new ways of generating 100s to hundreds of thousands of variable SNPs quickly and cost-effectively. In this post, I am compiling a list of North American facilities with capabilities for de novo genome-scale data generation and marker (i.</description>
