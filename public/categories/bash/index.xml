      <description>Jon Puritz and some other developers have hacked out a nice pipeline, named dDocent (pronounced &amp;ldquo;docent&amp;rdquo;), for genomic assembly, read mapping, and SNP calling using NGS data from the RAD-seq family of sequencing strategies. dDocent is nice because it pulls together several top-of-the-line existing tools, and because it provides reference-based and de novo assembly options.
Instructions for installing dDocent are given at the pipeline&amp;rsquo;s Bioconda Download and Install page, and are claimed to be &amp;ldquo;So easy your grandfather could do this&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>As many of you know, I use a UNIX/Mac system, and I spend a great deal of time working from the command line on UNIX and LINUX. One thing that everyone learns when they&amp;rsquo;re learning the UNIX/LINUX command line is that the &amp;ldquo;rm&amp;rdquo; command is a powerful and versatile option for deleting files. However, when we delete files with rm, they never come back, and thus they cannot be inspected afterward.</description>

      <description>Evolutionary biologists generally use nice java-written utility programs that come in the standard BEAST distribution to obtain post-burnin trees for summarizing the results of a converged BEAST run (or *BEAST run) that reached stationarity. Usually, only 5,000 to 20,000 trees are necessary for this, and these are typically obtained by cutting out &amp;lsquo;burnin&amp;rsquo; trees and then &amp;ldquo;thinning&amp;rdquo; trees from &amp;ldquo;.trees&amp;rdquo; output files using LogCombiner until the desired number of trees is reached.</description>
