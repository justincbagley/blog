      <title>How to find common variants in multiple VCF files</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What are the SNPs or variants that are shared in common between two VCF files I created (e.g. from different SNP discovery pipelines, or two treatments of an experiment)?&amp;rdquo;, you might ask.
Below, I provide a post based on my recent answer to this ResearchGate question that provides some solutions for this problem.
First, the vcftools --diff &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt; --diff-site option would work for this specific case. This option for the --diff flag is listed in the documentation as having the following function:</description>

So, according to blogdown authors (Xie et al. 2018), it&amp;rsquo;s been said before that,

 A quick search online returns blog posts and sites with several variations on this them (e.g. here and here) acknowledging the axiomatic importance of an online presence these days.</description>

      <description>JC model of sequence evolution from TreeThinkers.
BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) software provides a growing set of clear options for specifying evolutionary models of DNA substitution for alignments loaded into the program. However, the set of models that are readily available and &amp;ldquo;spelled out&amp;rdquo; in drop-down menus in the BEAUti (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility) GUI is much smaller compared to the standard set of 11 substitution schemes considered by other software programs for model selection (giving rise to a total of 88 models in jModelTest, or 56 models in PartitionFinder).</description>

      <description>BEAST v1.8.3 logo
In case you were unaware, Andrew Rambaut has made a new version of BEAST 1, v1.8.3, available for Mac, Windows and Linux (.dmg, .zip, .tgz) at the BEAST 1 GitHub website.
According to Andrew, new features of this version include:
 Generalized Stepping Stone sampling for Marginal Likelihood Estimation. Continuous quantile version of uncorrelated relaxed clock as option in BEAUti [from Li &amp;amp; Drummond 2012, MBE]. Option in BEAUti to log complete histories in Markov Jump Counting.</description>

      <description>BEAST2 logo
Hi guys, OK, in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, there is a new version of BEAST2, so make sure that you go get that update on GitHub. According to Remco Bouckaert, the new version, v2.3.2, improves the ability of the user to interact with data in BEAUti, and it also improves the efficiency of some BEAST functions, particularly the MRCAPrior. Moreover, LogCombiner has been fixed to ensure logcombiner burn in editing finished properly, and LogAnalyser now has one line per file mode.</description>

      <description>BEAST2 logo
A couple of months ago the developers released a new version of BEAST, v2.3.1. I like to remind myself and others to update your BEAST and its utilities to this latest version, which you can download it here.
BEAST v2.3.1 contains a number of important updates. Most notably, TreeAnnotator now has the default memory set to 4 Gb, and this will greatly help ambitious people who try to upload and summarize large numbers of trees, or the posterior distribution of trees from an analysis with many tree tips.</description>

      <description>Recently, I discovered something that I wrote about four years ago during the first part of my PhD, just 2 years or so after IMa2 had come out [around a year or so after Hey (2010)]. Back then, I was a little unhappy about the way parameters were coded, but now looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of funny, so I decided to post this as a blog entry. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;ve published with this method and have a much better understanding of it now.</description>

      <description>Hi BEAST users subscribed to justinbagley.org. As what is for many of you an academic summer starts winding down its backslope, this is a little reminder that you should try and finish all the BEAST analyses you&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off, and in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so already you should consider updating to the latest version of BEAST2, v2.3.0, which was released in June. Make sure you also update to the most up-to-date java version too; don&amp;rsquo;t worry, after the update BEAST v2.</description>

      <description>In case you were unaware, there is a community-driven &amp;ldquo;NeXML&amp;rdquo; movement in computational phylogenetics, led by several bioinformaticians including Rutger Vos who are attempting to harness technologies and advantages of the XML format for transforming NEXUS flat files (an older standard for storing systematic data) into a format that is more easily processed and manipulated. See NeXML.org for more info on this technology and for softwares that allow reading and writing NeXML etc.</description>

      <description>Mesquite is a very popular modular software for comparative evolutionary analyses involving phylogenies, one that I have used for a long time and actually like a lot.
A couple of weeks ago, in response to a reviewer who asked for me to use the latest version of Mesquite, version 2.75, instead of 2.74 (which I used for the analyses in the ms), I recently updated Mesquite to build 556. Then, yesterday, I realized that I had deleted a couple of module folders (e.</description>

      <description>Yet again, a new version of an important piece of software for molecular ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and biogeographers has just become available. Mary Kuhner and colleagues have just released a new version of the software program Lamarc, a program that originally only implemented likelihood analysis but now implements ML and Bayesian algorithms for estimating population migration rates (gene flow), population sizes, exponential growth rates and recombination rates. You can download the most up-to-date version of Lamarc, Lamarc v2.</description>

      <description>OK, heads up everyone using BEAST, or interested in summarizing and analyzing the results of Bayesian analyses in other software programs! There is a new version of the program Tracer available at Andrew Rambaut&amp;rsquo;s website. You can obtain the new version of Tracer, Tracer v1.6 by downloading the appropriate version here. The new version supports several new features, and here is a list of the new stuff they&amp;rsquo;ve added to the program, taken from the website:</description>

      <description>Andrew Rambaut has released the first version of a new software program, BEASTGen, that transforms phylogenetic data between the standard NEXUS, FASTA and BEAST XML formats. Could this mean that we are one step closer to calming many graduate students&amp;rsquo; (and other people&amp;rsquo;s) woes over this issue?
The new software can be downloaded from the BEAST Google code website, at https://code.google.com/p/beast-mcmc/downloads/detail?name=BEASTGen_v1.0.tgz.
Andrew has also written a brief set of instructions that can be found on the BEAST website, at http://beast.</description>

      <description>At the time of this writing, I am fortunate to be doing my PhD at BYU, which is a great environment to work on biogeography, systematics and evolution mainly because of the great people with similar interests that seem to always be attracted to the place. However, I am also very fortunate that at my institution we have excellent infrastructure and internal resources for conducting the highest quality research in molecular evolution and ecology.</description>

      <description>BEAST basics **A brief introduction to BEAST ** BEAST is a powerful computer program for evolutionary analysis developed by Andrew Rambaut and Alexei Drummond, as well as Marc Suchard, Simon Ho, Joseph Heled, and others. BEAST was originally designed to provide a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for simultaneously co-estimating phylogenies and divergence times (times to the most recent common ancestor, TMRCAs) from DNA sequence data (or amino acids) for one or multiple loci.</description>

      <guid>/2011/08/06/jmodeltest-will-not-run-with-single-quotes-around-tip-names/</guid>
      <description>A little while ago, I discovered a common error in jmodeltest is the error message that the number of sites appears to be wrong. I recently encountered this issue again. This is caused by single quotation marks on either side of tip names in a NEXUS file, which is a common form of the output / exported NEXUS file from DNASP. So, once you export a NEXUS from DNASP, say after doing some population level genetic analyses or after defining sequence groups for setting up structure in ARLEQUIN, you should simply open your NEXUS file in a word processor or text editor and use the &amp;ldquo;Replace&amp;rdquo; command to remove all quotation marks from your file.</description>
