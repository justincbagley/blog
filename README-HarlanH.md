This is the source code for my blog. 

As a reminder, here's how to post new stuff:

1. In RStudio, `Addins > New Post`. Put static images in `static/post`.
2. `Addins > Serve Site` and make sure it looks good locally.
3. Commit the code to GitHub.
4. Confirm it deployed via [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
