# Post

Wow, this is my first [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) post, written in Markdown from within the R console in RStudio Version 1.1.453 (released this year, available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)). No content for this one, so I'll just throw in a couple of quotes from some of my favorite evolutionary biologists, as follows:

>_“There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved.”_
>
> ― Charles Darwin, _The Origin of Species_


>_"In the world of the extended phenotype, ask not how an animal's behaviour benefits its genes; ask instead whose genes it is benefiting."_
>
> ― Richard Dawkins, _The Selfish Gene_
