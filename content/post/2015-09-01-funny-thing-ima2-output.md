Recently, I discovered something that I wrote about four years ago during the first part of my PhD, just 2 years or so after IMa2 had come out [around a year or so after Hey (2010)]. Back then, I was a little unhappy about the way parameters were coded, but now looking back, it's actually kind of funny, so I decided to post this as a blog entry. I mean, I've published with this method and have a much better understanding of it now. But this old scrap conveys how difficult and frustrating it can be to learn new software programs, as well as the propensity for early PhD students to freak out when having to learn the bewildering array of software one should master when preparing to become a professional in ecology, evolution, and systematics. It also does point out how difficult it can be to track the parameters in models, or adapt to changes in the input file format for different software.

You look down at "HISTOGRAM GROUP 2: MARGINAL DISTRIBUTION VALUES AND HISTOGRAMS OF POPULATION SIZE AND MIGRATION PARAMETERS" section of the output, which contains results for the posterior distributions of population size and migration parameters from your run.  Now, you see the parameter names as you expected... q0, q1, q2, m0>1, m1>0.  But your interpretation of all of these depends on "what" q0, q1, and q2 mean.  You realize you need this information, so you go to Hey & Nielsen (2004; the updated IM reference over the 2001 Hey and Nielsen paper that doesn't describe the current software algorithms), and you find populations are listed in the nice Fig. 1 with the IM speciation/vicariance model as "N1", "N2", and "NA", moving from the two daughter populations (tips) of the tree pointing to the top of the page down to the ancestral lineage.

While completing the IMa2 analyses I was doing at the time I wrote this, I realized I was correct about the parameter names. At first, I inferred this from the manuscripts and the results: IMa2 often struggles the most to estimate ancestral population size parameters (not the daughter population thetas) and migration parameters, so it made sense for the q2 value to be the ancestral theta because it's posterior distribution was being estimated as a very diffuse distribution when I was using just mtDNA. That left q0 and q1 to be the two daughter populations, and it made the most sense for the population with the lower subscript/number to be the first population in the data file, which indeed is the case.

However, later I found that, to my chagrin _and making it even funnier now_, I had forgotten that in IMa2 I was adding a little line of code to the input file. This little line of code was relatively new and had not been required in the original IM input file format, and it specified the population tree in newick format. I had also forgotten that the IMa2 manuals from 2009 and 2011 had shown examples of how to input the population tree in the input file, and that while their descriptions had involved more complex scenarios with four daughter populations and multiple ancestral populations they also showed that ancestral populations were always preceded by a colon in the notation. As per the example tree on p. 30 of the 2011 manual, given as "(0,1) :2," this would always be the newick tree for a model with two daughter populations. This gave the indirect evidence for matching the corresponding population size parameter names, which would of course be q0, q1 and q2. So, all along, the evidence I needed to figure out the parameter names and feel 100% confident about them was _in the manuals to begin with._

I highly recommend that you use IMa2. Just make sure you 1) read the papers and manuals very carefully and 2) correctly specify your population tree and interpret the parameter names! Also, if you write a manual for a software program, I highly recommend that you provide a graphic containing the actual parameter names you require in the input file, not a different set of names, so that it is easy to see the connection between the model and the syntax for arguments fed to the program.
