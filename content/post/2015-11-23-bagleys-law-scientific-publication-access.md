Let's also assume that library holdings / subscriptions at your institution have gaps--they do not cover every journal in your field over every possible time period.

Then, **Bagley's Law of Scientific Publication Access is:**

<blockquote>**"When you need an article, you will not have free access to it, but you will have access to plenty of articles that you don't want and you don't need."**</blockquote>

Of course, I wrote this while think of [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law), which it is related to (also see [the book](https://books.google.com.br/books?id=dTl9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT106&lpg=PT106&dq=cochrane's+aphorism&source=bl&ots=ycRuPwJxPy&sig=-P-9iupTaZGwpnZouS1FSOKAl2Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiM_qn6laXJAhVQmJAKHd8JC-QQ6AEISDAH#v=onepage&q=cochrane's%20aphorism&f=false)). Some might even consider this to be a special case of Murphy's Law! haha.

PS: Here's a version shortened for Twitter: "When you need an article, you won't have free access to it, but you'll have access to plenty of articles you don't want and you don't need."
