I am currently wrapping up a paper on GBS phylogeography of quaking aspen, _Populus tremuloides_ with several collaborators. See pic _below_:

Aspen are known to vary from diploid to triploid in natural populations, with many triploids (higher prevalence) in the Rockies. This is an issue with any population genomics study of aspen, or other forest trees with polyploidy. 

So, as a final touch on the manuscript, I need to estimate the occurrence of varying ploidy number across individuals in the dataset and see if ploidy is significantly affecting (e.g. correlated to) the results. Karen Mock at Utah State University is a collaborator on the current GBS project and has advised us to use the new [gbs2ploidy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbs2ploidy/index.html) R package written by Zack Gompert in their [2017 paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.12657) on the subject (Gompert and Mock 2017). 

I had some issues with the install, so to help others who might encounter similar issues, I am writing a post about what I ran into and how to overcome the problems (which will probably be general, not reflecting simply a user-specific case).
