I just found out about this and it is definitely going on my Want List.  Spring has just this year published Nick Swenson's new book entitled _Functional and Phylogenetic Ecology in R_.  This book looks very useful for anyone interested in phylogenetic analysis of ecological adaptation or diversity using the R environment.  Check it out and buy it direct from Spring [here](http://www.springer.com/statistics/computational+statistics/book/978-1-4614-9541-3).

One cool thing about this book is that it provides examples on integrating R code with code/programs from Python and C.  Another interesting departure from phylogenetic comparative methods books is that this text has a more ecological focus.  It seems like it will be user friendly, and that unlike some other books its readers will be able to work the examples and then directly modify the code provided to conduct their own analyses of ecological traits and diversity/community data.
