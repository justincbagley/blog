Reading this cool new paper on the diversity and phylogenetic structure of ant communities in Costa Rica...  [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00631.x/full](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00631.x/full)

I enjoy reading new papers to learn about who to use the latest phylogenetic methods to study adaptation and community diversity and assembly.  One thing I like about Ecography papers is that they are quick reads.

I would love to have the opportunity to do this same kind of study on fishes or other taxa from biodiversity hotspots.  I already know how to run phylocom and how to use R to manage large datasets.  Where is the data/collaborator?  That's the question!
