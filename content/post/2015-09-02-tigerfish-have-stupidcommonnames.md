I posted this little graphic earlier [@JBagz1](https://twitter.com/JBagz1) to support the exposition of stupid common names on Twitter today (hashtag #stupidcommonnames). A guilty pleasure, but I had so much fun in the very short time I spent making it that I decided to also post it here. Go check the rest of the stupid common names other scientists have identified and have a good laugh. "Tigerfish", or "Tiger Fish" is definitely a stupid name: these fish don't look like tigers, aren't codistributed with tigers, don't interact with tigers, and generally aren't really formally associated with tigers (or any other mammals, except human sport fishermen) in any way.Â
