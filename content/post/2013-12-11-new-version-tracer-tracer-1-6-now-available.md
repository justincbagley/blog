OK, heads up everyone using BEAST, or interested in summarizing and analyzing the results of Bayesian analyses in other software programs!  There is a new version of the program Tracer available at Andrew Rambaut's website.  You can obtain the new version of Tracer, Tracer v1.6 by downloading the appropriate version [here](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). The new version supports several new features, and here is a list of the new stuff they've added to the program, taken from the website:

  * Multilocus 'Skygrid' analysis option - use this option when analysing BEAST output generated under this model.
  * Density plots are now drawn as kernal density estimates (KDEs) instead of histograms.
  * Traces can be designated as integer or categorical with appropriate plots and statistics given.
If you haven't downloaded a new version of Tracer in awhile, you may also notice several other new features... and obviously there have been some bug fixes.  So get the new version!

Cheers ~ J
