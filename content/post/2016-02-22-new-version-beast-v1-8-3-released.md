[![beast](http://www.justinbagley.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/beast.png)](http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk)In case you were unaware, Andrew Rambaut has made a new version of BEAST 1, v1.8.3, available for Mac, Windows and Linux (.dmg, .zip, .tgz) at the [BEAST 1 GitHub website](https://github.com/beast-dev/beast-mcmc/releases/tag/v1.8.3).

According to Andrew, new features of this version include:

  * Generalized Stepping Stone sampling for Marginal Likelihood Estimation.
  * Continuous quantile version of uncorrelated relaxed clock as option in BEAUti [from Li & Drummond 2012, MBE].
  * Option in BEAUti to log complete histories in Markov Jump Counting.
  * Jukes-Cantor added as an option for BEAUti nucleotide substition model.
  * New tree transition kernel (SubTreeLeap operator) implementd in BEAST.
  * Defaulting to randomizing rate categories for DiscretizedBranchRates.
  * BEAUti 'guess dates' options are now persistent from run to run (and shared with Path-O-Gen/Tempest).
  * Transmission tree model of Hall et al (2016) implemented.
  * Fast, general multidimensional scaling (MDS) implemented.
  * Clock panel in BEAUti simplified.
  * Parameter linking available in Priors panel in BEAUti.
  * Command line is logged into log file headers for reference.
  * Plus bug fixes.

I personally am downloading the update and running stepping stone sampling for MLEs for Bayes factors. What in the new version appeals most to you?
