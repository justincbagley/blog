Still learning to use R, so I find myself constantly winding my way back  to the same online resources to guide me.  Here are some links to some  greatly insightful pages, some of which are links pages more or less  themselves.  I hope they help you as well.  
  
Dolph Schluter's software page, including R packages  
[http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~schluter/software.html](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~schluter/software.html)  
...e.g., Dolph's PhySim program manual [here ](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PhySim/PhySim.pdf)can help simulate phylogenetic trees under a birth-death process  
  
Awesome Psychology and Statistics R resource page

Dolph Schluter's R Tips... kick ass!

More specifically, and very helpful to me... Dolph Schluter's graphics tips

Big list of R documentation contributions

Adding a straight line to a scatterplot?  just type in the intercept then slope using the abline command:

R  for biologists and psychologists... these slightly suck, because they  give somewhat limited coverage, but they're good for beginners (gets you  up to ANOVA/ANCOVA I think).
