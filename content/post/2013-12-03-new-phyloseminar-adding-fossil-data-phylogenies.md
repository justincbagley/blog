Just FYI, there was yet another great phyloseminar, today, as part of a series of talks on using fossil data in phylogenetics (two weeks ago, Tracy Heath gave a talk on the Fossilized Birth-Death process model).

Today's talk, which I missed but will watch later since these are always recorded, was given by Daniel Ksepka (NESCENT) and was entitled, "Including Fossil Taxa in Phylogenies: Advances and Issues".

I suspect that a lot of people missed this talk but will want to see it!  So, see [http://phyloseminar.org/](http://phyloseminar.org/) for more details and a video of the talk!  You can also login to Google+ and then watch Daniel's talk, e.g. [here](https://plus.google.com/events/ctk8o2iu8bf4h4rgg5vsprprj48).
