**A Javascript library I didn't know about**  
I love phylogenies.  Still, even I only recently (three years late!) noticed that in 2010 a paper was published in PLoS ONE providing a method for visualizing phylogenetic trees directly within-browser using javascript.  Apparently the javascript library, jsPhyloSVG, the authors created is showcased online at [http://www.jsphylosvg.com/](http://www.jsphylosvg.com/).  Here is the citation for the paper:  
  
Smits SA, Ouverney CC, 2010 **jsPhyloSVG: A Javascript Library for Visualizing Interactive and Vector-Based Phylogenetic Trees on the Web.**   
[PLoS ONE 5(8): e12267. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012267](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0012267)  
  
**Where's the love?**  
Not to be complaining or anything, and no one is paying me to say this, but I can't help but notice that while a cursory glance at the jsphylosvg website reveals that the library creates pretty slick and apparently easily manipulable and publication-quality graphics, basically _no one _has used this method, or at least cited it.  A quick search on Google Scholar shows that this paper is starting to gain citations, but still it only has been cited a measly 9 times!  Now, I'm fairly new at this gig and just beginning my career etc., so I am only starting to accumulate publications and citations, and like anyone I would love for my pubs to be cited more!  But for a new tool that's available for the whole world to use, this is downright _under-used_.  So, I ask, "Where's the love for interactive javascript tree graphics?"  See the jsphylosvg website to play with this "new" tool.  In the meantime, I'll be doing the same the next time I have more than a min to knock out a blog post (I know, you're probably think, he hasn't used it either!).  Maybe it's good, maybe it sucks, but anyway let's go find out.  
  
Please let me know if you've used jsPhyloSVG and what you thought about it.  Cheers.
