From time to time, we make mistakes in programming or testing a new `R` script or function, only to find that `R` "freezes" and appears to be stuck, or working but giving the impression that it will take an eternity to complete the computation. What could be happening is that the process is based on an maximum-likelihood estimation of a parameter that requires convergence, you could have accidentally (e.g. by default) run a function that needs to visit the total number of models possible for your dataset or a certain amount of parameter space. Alternatively, there might be an issue with FORTRAN coding. Or, the function you're using might require a maximum number of iterations to be specified, or else it will use an exhaustive search. `R` can "hang" for these and many other reasons.

Today, I'm doing a short post to show you how to get out of this situation by killing the process in `R` from outside the `R` environment. Specifically, I'll show you how to do this from mac [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)), i.e. the command line.

First do the following at the command line to obtain a list of processes including `R`:

```
ps aux | grep R
```

Look through the resulting list of PIDs (process IDs, which are unique identifiers for each process) and info for the `R` process, which will likely be using a great deal of CPU (%CPU; eg. %CPU >90%), and thus will be near the top of the list (which will be in decreasing order). Here is an example of the results of running this code from my terminal to ongoing processes, including an `R` analysis (this is just an excerpt, the output was much longer):

An alternative way of getting this information on mac is to use the [Activity Monitor app](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201464), but we're not covering that here. OK, now armed with this information you can use the kill command to identify and stop the analysis. In my example above, the process ID for the `R` process is 334, and this process is consuming 93.2% of the CPU and 12.7% of the computer's memory, so we can stop this analysis by entering the following command at the command line:

```
kill -s INT 334
```

Two great things about this are 1) that this is easily accomplished at the command line, and 2) that you don't have to call `R` or alter `R`, or do "force quit" (e.g. by pressing option + command + Esc), you only have to stop the offending process. So, this means that `R` will not be closed as a result of these actions, but will be "liberated" from the hung prodess. As a result, your log of commands and output will not be lost.

Just as a tip, if you are worried about losing your command history at any time, you can usually save this from `R` even if the `R` environment/GUI hangs on an analytical process by first clicking the "Show/Hide R command history" button at the top of the `R` GUI, and then clicking "Save History."
