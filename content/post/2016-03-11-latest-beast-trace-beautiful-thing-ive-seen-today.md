My new \*BEAST (starbeast) species tree runs are converging wonderfully in BEAST v1.8.3, so I am off to a great start this morning. Here, I'm including a screenshot of the results of one of these runs, which I ran for 200 million generations using 3 normally distributed calibration points, as visualized in Tracer. Note the good posterior trace, very high ESS scores for all parameter estimates, and good use of burn-in (default 10% value works quite well in this case).

This is the most beautiful thing I've seen in my research today, or even this week!

I am now checking and processing the results from multiple such runs using different species schemes (trait mapping schemes/files). They seem like they are going to give me a nice estimate of the species tree for this dataset.

Currently, the second steps of these runs are still running, using path sampling/stepping-stone sampling to calculate marginal likelihood estimates (MLE) for each model. When this is completed, I will calculate Bayes factors for each model and use them for Bayes factor species delimitation (BFD) _sensu_ Grummer et al. (2014). 

Is anyone else working on BFD analyses like this right now? Would love to hear from you.
