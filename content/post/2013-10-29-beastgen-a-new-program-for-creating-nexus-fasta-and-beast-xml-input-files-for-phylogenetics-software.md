Andrew Rambaut has released the first version of a new software program, BEASTGen, that transforms phylogenetic data between the standard NEXUS, FASTA and BEAST XML formats. Could this mean that we are one step closer to calming many graduate students' (and other people's) woes over this issue?  
  
The new software can be downloaded from the BEAST community website as part of the BEAST v1+ distribution, [here](http://beast.community/installing) [update: new site, last accessed May 1, 2019] or [here](https://code.google.com/p/beast-mcmc/downloads/detail?name=BEASTGen_v1.0.tgz) (old link).  
  
Andrew has also written a brief set of instructions that can be found on the BEAST website, at [http://beast.community/beastgen](http://beast.community/beastgen).
