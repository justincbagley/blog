Hi BEAST users subscribed to justinbagley.org.  Here's a note to serve as a little reminder that, when you have a moment, you should update your BEAST2 software package to the latest version, v2.2.1, which was released last week.

As always, the new BEAST2 version works with the most up-to-date versions of java (e.g. version 8 update 31 from January, or version 8 update 40), which you no doubt have recently downloaded since they came out in the past three months.  Don't put off using the latest version because you don't want there to be clashes between different utilities or packages.  Plus there are hundreds of bug fixes over v2.1.3 and new versions of things like DensiTree!
